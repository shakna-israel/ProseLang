# ProseLang
Inspired by [Transcript](https://esolangs.org/wiki/TRANSCRIPT), a conceptual estoric programming language.

---

ProseLang is an ongoing process in the very early stages.

A full specification is not yet ready, and thus, not ready to be implemented in any language.

The current endeavor to flesh out a spec is available at [ConceptualSpecification.md](ConceptualSpecification.md), dicussion and pull requests are welcome.

The long term goals are:

* Develop into a Touring-complete language, allowing it to be easily implemented.
* Implement a simple implementation in Python for quick scripting.
* Implement a compiler in C/D, allowing programs to be written and compiled easily.
